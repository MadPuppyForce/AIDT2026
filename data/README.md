## Required Files

For each domain, you must download the following three files:

* `session_item.csv`
* `bundle_item.csv`
* `session_bundle.csv`

There are three available domains:

* `food`

* `electronics`

In the official repository, these files are located in:

```
bundle_recommendation/dataset/<domain>/
```

Each domain has its own dedicated folder containing the three `.csv` files.
